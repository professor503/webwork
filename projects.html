        <p>Founded in <b>1992</b>, ARCHITECH began as a small design studio in a refurbished warehouse in
            <b>Chicago</b>, established by visionary architect <i>Naeem ur Rahman</i> and structural engineer <b>Clara
                Moreno.</b> United by a passion for innovation and timeless design, their mission was clear:<i>to
                challenge the boundaries of traditional architecture while honoring the rich legacy of classical
                form</i> .

            In its early years, ARCHITECH focused on urban revitalization projects, breathing new life into aging
            industrial spaces. By the late 1990s, their reputation for sustainable design and creative problem-solving
            had earned them national acclaim.

            The company expanded internationally in the early 2000s, opening studios in Berlin, Dubai, and Singapore,
            and taking on a diverse portfolio of work — from high-rise commercial towers to award-winning cultural
            landmarks. ARCHITECH became synonymous with forward-thinking architecture, blending technology, art, and
            nature.

            Over the past three decades, ARCHITECH has grown into a multidisciplinary firm, with a team of architects,
            planners, interior designers, and urban strategists. The firm's signature style is marked by clean lines,
            innovative use of materials, and an unwavering commitment to sustainability.

            <br>Today, ARCHITECH continues to lead the future of architecture, staying true to its founding belief:
            <i>“Great architecture is not only built — it is felt.”</i>

            <h3>Minimalism – have less, be more!<br>
                The existing building was designed earlier and performed an industrial<br> function.
                In accordance with the task, it was<br> impossible to change the contours of the<br> plan, but it was
                possible to make changes to the structure <br>of the building and add one floor, part of which was to be
                used as a terrace.
                It was necessary to find an organic solution<br> for the facades that best suited the building plans<br>
                and the latest trends in modern architecture.
